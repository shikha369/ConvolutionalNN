In this assignment we trained and tested a convolutional neural network for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
We used a variation of the VGG-network proposed in Very Deep Convolutional Networks For Large-scale Image Recognition (Simonyan, Zisserman; 2015).

The original code has been taken from source mentioned below and we made modifications as per our experiment setup.

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.
